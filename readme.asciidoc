Sync videos


=== What is it? ===

A website for people to create synced pairs of Youtube videos and play them.

=== Why? ===

Have you seen the insane amount of cameras recording live events from different angles? Nothing is being done with these videos.

=== How will it work? ===

You sync videos in pairs. 

First you choose two points of view of the same thing and take note of their Youtube video IDs.

Then you place them in the Builder. There you can mark a common point in both videos.

After that, Multitube should figure out a way to play them perfectly in sync.

=== Does it work yet? ===

Check the project backlog in the  `todo` file.


=== Can I use it to sync some videos? === 

Knock yourself out. Be warned that it is in an *extremely alpha* stage, it is unstable and will probably not play stuff in sync unless you click `seek all` three or more times.
